# Give Life- Predict Blood Donations

Blood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals. According to WebMD, "about 5 million Americans need a blood transfusion every year". The raw data is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. The project predicted whether or not a donor would give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.The data analysis is documented in [notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Give-Life--Predict-Blood-Donations/blob/master/notebook.ipynb). The raw data files are also stored in the repository.
